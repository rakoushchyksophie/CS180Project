# CS18000 Auction House Team Project

Program utilizing Java interfaces and classes to ultimately create an interactive Java Application where a user may list auctions and bid on other item listings.
This program is part of a multi-phase Java project for CS18000 designed to simulate an interactive Auction House social platform. Users can list items for auction, place bids, view auctions in progress, and communicate with other users via a client-server model. Phase 2 focuses on building communication functionality between a client and a server, using a database to persist auction data.

## Features
- Create Buyer Account
- Create Seller Account
- Password protected user accounts
- Creating auction listings with timers, buy now prices, and bidding options
- Buyer accounts may bid on auctions or use the buy it now option to purchase an item as a seller-determined price.
- Database to contain all listings and user accounts
- Search functionality for both Users and Item listings
- Messaging between Buyers and Sellers
- Account deletion && Authorized Password Changes

## Software Architecture
- Uses Client <-> Server relationship between objects to communicate with and take from database.
- Clients may interact with each other using messages sent over server which includes solely thread and file safe operations.
- All data is hard-stored within .txt files only accessible through requests sent through the server.

## Installation
- Change to desired Directory
- Clone the Repo
- $ git clone https://github.com/hsupple/CS180Project.git

### Running Locally:
1. Clone the repository or download the `.zip` file.
2. Navigate to the root folder in terminal or command line.
3. Compile:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```
4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    java AuctionServer
    ```
5. In a new terminal window, start the client:
    ```bash
    java AuctionClient
    ```

## Test Cases
- Ensure you have a JUnit test case extension on your IDE
- Ensure Server is running while JUnit tests are activated

## Roadmap for Future Weeks
- Create a GUI to make the design interactive and functional for a user
- Link GUI with stack to ensure inputs can be controlled from the interface.
